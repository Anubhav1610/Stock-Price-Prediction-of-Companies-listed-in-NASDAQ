The data is derived from yahoo and the data is collected from the past 10 years to till date, from this data 80% of data is used to train the model and rest 20% of data is used to test the model. 

LSTM model - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. It is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points, but also entire sequences of data.
